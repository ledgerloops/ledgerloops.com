OpenTabs: Money without Currency

abstract:
This whitepaper proposes a novel money transfer system, called OpenTabs. Its defining feature is
that money flows in the system are decomposed into a sum of local cycles. This allows the system
to achieve transitivity of money transfers, while avoiding transitivity of trust. Intuitively, the
money being transferred in multiple hops through the network is anonymized after each hop, and
individual transfer hops are achieved without reliance on a trusted third party or on a trusted
currency. This feature sets the system apart from not only government-backed currencies and banks,
but also from blockchain-based crypto-currencies.

Motivation

Efficient exchange of services requires some form of money. Most money systems are vulnerable to
rent extraction by speculation on fluctuations in a currency's value. Ripple is not, but requires a UNL.
