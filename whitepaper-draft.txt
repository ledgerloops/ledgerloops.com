OpenTabs: Cross-ledger Settlements without Trust

abstract:
Debt and money transfers are typically recorded in ledgers that record the state of a number of
bank accounts or wallets. Transferring money is then only possible within the same ledger, or through
a federation protocol that forms a connection between two or more ledgers.

This whitepaper proposes a novel system for federating ledgers, called OpenTabs. Its defining feature is
that settlements can occur without transitivity of trust, and without exposing the full content of
the ledgers involved to the rest of the network.


Introduction

Ledgers for transferring money can typically be either private to the parties involved (like a piece of paper or a spreadsheet),
managed by a trusted third party (like a traditional bank),
or open and public (like the Bitcoin ledger).

Each of these ledger types have their own advantages and drawbacks. A private ledger only allows settling debts
within a closed group of participating parties.
A traditional bank needs to be trusted, will likely extract rent
from its customers' account balance, and typically needs to be backed by a trusted government in order to provide a reliable service.
An open public ledger needs to be trusted based on network consensus and community politics, and requires parties to keep their
account number secret, or deal with the side-effect of making all details about their assets and transactions public.

OpenTabs is a novel protocol for cross-ledger settlements that allows private ledgers to be federated without the need for an
additional third-party ledger or public ledger.


Motivation

Both third-party ledgers and public ledgers have disadvantages, meaning parties may choose to keep their ledgers private to only
the debtors and creditors involved. Using a private ledger avoids making sensitive information public, and avoids the risk involved
in trusting a third party like a bank, or a network community like Bitcoin or a Ripple UNL. For a more complete and opionated
motivation, see Appendix A

Appendix A: Full Motivation

Capitalism forms a layer of power that is starting to stand above humanity, in the sense that humans are not organized enough
to control or veto outcomes of financial processes. As giant companies will use more artificial intelligence, they will become
more powerful, and create more powerful monopolies on the job market. Big companies will make their employees work for the interests
of that company, which may not align with the interests of the humans affected by this activity. In particular, this may lead to two
problems.

First, an ever smaller portion of the profit a company makes will flow back to the employees, as long as the job market allows this
and employees are not effectively organized to negotiate their working conditions.

Second, an ever smaller portion of employees will work on activities that actually benefit humans, and more employees will instead
be hired to work on things like advertising and patent wars, whose benefit to humanity is only marginal.

Technology is making humanity every more efficient in producing value, but this surplus may more and more be directed to what David
Gaeber calls Bullshit Jobs. A possible doom scenario for humanity, extrapolating from the current trend, would be a dystopia where
all resources are owned by large companies, and humans work an ever larger portion of their time on advancing the power of the company
they work for, and an ever smaller portion of their time on actually producing value for humanity.

When the percentage of time humanity spends on useful work drops under, say, 10%, it will become very attractive for people to move
off the grid, and work in worker cooperations instead of in commercial companies. Eventually, worker coops would be more productive
than commercial companies, because their workers can spend 100% of their time on creating value for humanity.

To organize such worker coops, and the trade between them, traditional bank services can not necessarily be trusted indefinitely.
For instance, they may require customers to trade in government-backed currencies only, and as the gap between the very rich and
the rest of the world becomes more extreme, a day's wage will of a worker will represent such a small spending power compared to the
world average spending power per person, that traditional currencies become unstable, and workers in a coop would choose instead to pay
themselves in local currencies (for instance in a "Bank of Time" system). Even if traditional banks will continue to play a central
role in providing services to their customers, innovation in ledger technology is an exciting research field that might one day have
a big impact in improving people's daily lives.

This doom scenario, where humanity and its democratic governments lose control over currency stability, is probably very unlikely to
happen within the next 25 years, but it could possibly happen on the longer term, especially if artificial intelligence advances reach
the singularity (where machines become smarter than humans for the first time). Working on better finance tools for humans could possibly
provide protection against the unwanted effects of AI-driven investment power, and help protect the freedom of humans to work for the
benefit of humans.
