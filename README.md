# LedgerLoops
This repo contains:

* the html content of http://ledgerloops.com
* the LaTeX source of the [LedgerLoops whitepaper (pdf)](http://ledgerloops.com/doc/whitepaper.pdf)
* the browserify source of the [demo page](http://ledgerloops.com/demo.html)

The code in this repo is very much ripe for a rewrite from scratch
- it has served me well while developing the protocol, but it was never meant as
more than a demo implementation for experimentation.

The real product, so far, of this research project is the current version of the LedgerLoops protocol, as described in the
[whitepaper](http://ledgerloops.com/doc/whitepaper.pdf).
