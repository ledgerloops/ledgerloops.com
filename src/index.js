// out-of-scope, but could be provided by plugins in later versions of this

// at this point, charlie will notify alice, and alice can use her credit with charlie to settle her debt with bob.
// each agent only knows, only interacts with, and only trusts their own direct debtors and creditors.
// Yet the network can still find a second-order promise loop where all peer-to-peer debts are settled.
// See console output for a log of the messages each agent sends in the process.
