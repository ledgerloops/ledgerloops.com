    <h2>History of the LedgerLoops Project</h2>
    <p>I (<a href="https://michielbdejong.com">Michiel de Jong</a>) started LedgerLoops as a simple IOU-centric e-invoicing protocol, proposed in <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/unhosted/c/2IUC2ralu-U/m/qwGENz65t_EJ">a 2011 post to the Unhosted mailinglist</a>.
      Post-capitalism discussion and research on how this system could be used between humans and possibly
      also organisations happened under the name "OpenTabs".</p>
    <p>In the fall of 2016, I added a signature-based loop resolution algorithm (see <a href="./whispering-merchants.html">Whispering Merchants</a>) which <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-interledger/2016Dec/0032.html">
      had a lot in common</a> with the Interledger protocol,
      or at least a <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/408">circular version</a> thereof.</p>
    <p>In 2021 and 2022 we held a weekly brainstorm meeting around <a href="https://federatedbookkeeping.org">Federated Bookkeeping</a> which kept alive the original IOU-centric e-invoicing vision, adding a focus on data portability. A non-profit company,
      <a href="https://pondersource.com">Ponder Source</a> was created with the goal of bringing <a href="https://github.com/pondersource/CYB">Connect Your Books</a> to market, which we basically failed to do.</p>
    <p>And then in 2023, something amazing happened: at a meeting in the beautiful hills of Austria, <a href="https://matslats.net/cofi-is-now-a-thing=">Collaborative Finance (CoFi) was born</a>.
      We can now refer to some <a href="https://matslats.net/sites/matslats.net/files/Constructing_systems_of_exchange_Slater.pdf">generic theory (PDF)</a> about
      Collaborative Finance and can rephrase LedgerLoops as a P2P CoFi system.</p>
    <p>LedgerLoops is published free of patents, under the CreativeCommons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">BY-SA</a> license.</p>
    <p>Since LedgerLoops is patent-free, anybody will be allowed to claim their software is "LedgerLoops-compatible" without prior permission, as long as you don't directly call your software "LedgerLoops".
      We might create a test suite to certify compatibility, if people are interested in that.</p>
    <h2>Two Mechanisms for P2P CoFi</h2>
    <p>In a credit networks, various economic arrangements can take place - the most important ones probably being barter, lending, netting, payment, factoring and market making (see <a href="./economic-arrangments.html">Economic Arrangements</a> for my definitions).
      LedgerLoops offers two mechanisms that can help with that.</p>
    <h3>Decentralised Loop Detection (DLD)</h3>
    <p>In the <a href="https://github.com/ledgerloops/strategy-pit">Strategy Pit</a> repository, I'm currently pitching different decentralised loop detection algorithms against each other. I hope to have something working before the
      <a href="https://commonseconomy.notion.site/COLLABORATIVE-FINANCE-2-Serving-Local-Communities-c2ae55edfce0439ab139b857ae8b3ee4">CoFi 2 gathering in Banja Luka</a>.</p>
    <h3>Hashlocked Loop Resolution (HLR)</h3>
    <p>The loop resolution algorithm I invented in 2016 and described on this website as a <a href="./whispering-merchants.html">solution to the Whispering Merchants problem</a> can be described as "making an Interledger payment to yourself", or as "a DEX on trustlines".
    There can be multiple variations of it in operation in the same credit network - for instance with / without timeouts, different mechanisms to express units of value, or with SHA-256 vs other hash functions.</p>
